# Priority Todo List

Still currently in development, but usable

### Setting up

##### Requirements
- React Native 0.74.x
- TypeScript 5.4.x
- Expo 51.0.x
- Yarn 1.22.x


App is still in progress being publish to app stores, but can create development build in `./app` with `eas`. 

<sub>For privacy reasons, a temporary solution involves server details stored in `./app/src/temp.tsx`</sub>

Server runs with `yarn start` in `./server`, default port `4321`
